degenerate Pali, influenced the creation of the two modern languages Hindi and
Marathi differently.

# Dependencies
This program is built on Python 2.7 and requires the user to have installed
NLTK. It builds upon the IndicNLP library, which is included within the
project. 

# Data
We ran the confusability_matrix.py python file to generate our program.data raw
data file. This summarizes the results of our findings based on the relative
corpora available.
