# indic-lang-development
The goal of this project is to use principles of Natural Language

degenerate Pali, influenced the creation of the two modern languages Hindi and
Marathi differently.

# Dependencies
This program is built on Python 2.7 and requires the user to have installed
NLTK. It builds upon the IndicNLP library, which is included within the
project. 

# Data
To run the program on our data files on Windows, run `python confusability_matrix.py`.
To run the program on our data files on Unix, run `make`.
This will output the data in a file called program.data

Our current data is stored in the final.data file
